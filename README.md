# synthetic-star-field-detection-and-RSO-streak-classification
Synthetic star field images are generated and processed to detect stars and simulate streaks representing space objects. Using blob and Hough transform detection, stars and streaks are classified with a Random Forest. Sub-pixel centroiding refines star positions, and orientation of streaks is estimated for analysis.
